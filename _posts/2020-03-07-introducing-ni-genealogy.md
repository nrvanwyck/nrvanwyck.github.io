The site is available [here](http://ni-genealogy.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/). Deployed with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, NI Genealogy gives family history researchers a new way to navigate household records from Griffith's Valuation (completed in 1868), the 1901 Census of Ireland, and the 1911 Census of Ireland for counties Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry, and Tyrone. Records can be browsed by individual townlands, so you can see easily see how the population of a townland changed over time. Interactive Folium maps throughout the site allow visitors to see the boundaries of individual townlands; users can toggle on Mapbox satellite tiles to see aerial views of the region, which is useful when trying to identify individual lots of land specified in Griffith's Valuation.
